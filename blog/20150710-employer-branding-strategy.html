The term refers to the firm&#39;s brand as an employer and has traditionally been outward-facing and advertising-driven.</p><p>Not anymore. The rise of social media and employer review sites has made companies a lot more transparent (even though the primary contributors are grumpy former employees) and caused people to lose trust in recruitment advertising. Employer branding is increasingly seen as a function of the whole organization and as a long-term strategic objective that falls under the responsibility of high-ranking leadership. So just how should an organization go about creating its employer brand? Here are some fundamental best practices.</p><p><strong>Be clear about what the company stands for</strong><br>The company&#39;s vision, mission and corporate values should be clearly defined and resonate through overall brand strategy and communications on every platform.</p><p>A great example of this is Twitter. The company is very clear on what it stands for, and its product and operations are obviously aligned. Its mission is:</p><p><em>&quot;To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.&quot;</em></p><p>Which is supported by its values of:</p><p>• Grow our business in a way that makes us proud</p><p>• Communicate fearlessly to build trust</p><p>• Recognize that passion and personality matter</p><p>• Defend and respect the user&#39;s voice</p><p>• Reach every person on the planet</p><p>• Seek diverse perspectives</p><p>• Simplify</p><p><strong>Know the answers to the following three questions</strong></p><p>1. Why would someone want to work for you?<br>2. What is the perception employees and candidates have about your employer brand?<br>3. What percentage of your employees would recommend your company as a great place to work?</p><p>Although they might seem rudimentary, these three questions are the basis for any successful employer branding campaign.</p><p><strong>Who&#39;s in charge? Or is it a team effort?</strong><br>In recent years we have seen employer branding move away from an HR responsibility and many leaders now placing the <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/05/ceos-need-to-pay-attention-to-employer-branding">primary responsibility with the CEO or marketing</a>, as the Harvard Business Review highlighted. However, where the personnel responsible for the employer brand come from, is not a debate we should be having. The people responsible should be clearly defined and the real focus should be on how the firm develops and executes value building employer branding strategy.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about how you can regain control of your employer brand, and spread real stories about your employer brand, head over to <a href="http://www.lifeguides.me/employer_brand/">LifeGuides</a>.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on LifeGuides.</em></p></article></main><div class="shim reversed"></div><aside><h1>Have a project we can help with?</h1><a href="/contact">Talk To Us <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></aside><div class="shim"></div><footer><nav><a href="/services">Services</a> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> <a href="/company">Company</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> <a href="/contact">Contact</a></nav><p id="social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-facebook-official"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://medium.com/@SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-medium"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/syrinx-consulting-corporation"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p><p>Copyright &copy; 2016 Syrinx Consulting Corporation.
