<h1>Is there a silver bullet for native cross-platform mobile app creation?</h1>

<p>The app market is competitive, to say the least. There are thousands of brands building apps that fight for customers&#39; interest, which gives consumers not only a wealth of options but a wealth of market power. These consumers, by the actions taken via the brands&#39; apps, send important and immediate messages to companies about the relative importance of their app, and ultimately, their brand. This heightened state of competition and consumer power puts a lot of pressure on brands to build the right apps with the right features; and needless to say these apps must absolutely be optimized for mobile and every device on every platform.</p>

<p>As a result, brands nowadays must not only launch a mobile app, but they also need to ensure that it&#39;s one of the best available. And on top of that, those apps should be feature-rich and accessible on a variety of mobile devices and operating systems. This puts a lot of pressure on businesses, especially when they don&#39;t have any expertise whatsoever in mobile app development – let alone creating apps natively on multiple platforms. But as it stands, consumers aren&#39;t letting any brands off the hook.</p>

<p>This means that companies need to think and act fast. They must have tools that make native cross-platform app development easy and lifecycle management just as simple, and they should have teams of expert consultants to help guide them through app building and assist with support. These are the precautions that other brands with great apps are taking to succeed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Xamarin allows companies to provide mobile app users with better experiences.</p></blockquote>

<h2>A solution for rapid development</h2>

<p>Therefore, it&#39;s no surprise that many consider Xamarin, a cloud-based rapid development platform, to be a silver bullet for native cross-platform mobile app creation and management. As Maribel Lopez, founder of Lopez Research, said in an article for Forbes, a tool such as Xamarin allows companies to provide mobile app users with better experiences, and it offers brands a solution for quickly developing, scaling and supporting apps throughout their entire lifecycles. This way, every organization can compete in the mobile app market.</p>

<p>In fact, Xamarin has become one of the most popular mobile app development platforms. Lopez reported that in just 12 months, the number of developers leveraging Xamarin has increased 98 percent. It&#39;s because this platform truly gives app users a native experience, and that&#39;s all thanks to a coding language called C# – pronounced &quot;see sharp.&quot;</p>

<p>In short, C# is perfect for mobile app development, especially when time-to-market is important. It was designed for app creation, and it is familiar enough for developers with skills in C and C++ – two very popular coding languages. But C# really shines when Xamarin is involved.</p>

<h2>With C# in the mix</h2>

<p>Jim Bennett, a Xamarin-certified developer, spoke to Sam Atkinson of DZone to explain the phenomena that is Xamarin and C# mobile app development. Xamarin is a cloud-based platform for developing, hosting and managing mobile apps, and on the development side of things, it provides developers with frameworks for app creation.</p>

<p>Most importantly, as Bennett said, Xamarin takes C# code and converts it into native code for iOS and Android. This code is functionally the same as what&#39;s in other iOS apps, and in Android&#39;s case, developers get native byte-code after compiling. No emulation is involved. In other words, Xamarin does the heavy lifting. It creates native experiences from C# – a coding language is much easier to use.</p>

<p>With a solution that enables brands to provide their customers with great app experiences, the only thing left is to debug and launch a mobile app. After all, nowadays, consumers will put down any mobile app that has glitches or frequently crashes. According to AppDynamics, 86 percent of U.S. mobile users send apps to the trash if they encounter too many problems.</p>

<h2>A platform plus an experienced team equals success</h2>

<p>Thankfully, Xamarin can help in that regard as well. It provides developers and testing teams with access to thousands of real mobile devices via the cloud, ensuring that they can put their apps through the rigors before releasing it to the public. Better yet, Bennett explained that user interface frameworks are complex enough to capture screenshots of problems. That way, testers are the first people to discover bugs and glitches, not end users.</p>

<p>Of course, no platform or technology will create the best mobile app development strategy, or the app itself for that matter. Xamarin might be a powerful tool for app creation but without a keen understanding of the complexities of managing a project of that scale or a team of qualified mobile app developers, brands could get lost. Companies can benefit from partnering with experienced mobile app consultants that provide expertise as well as technical assistance like many other corporations have done in the past to provide their customers with great mobile experiences.</p><hr /><h1>When It&#39;s Time To Create A Mobile App</h1>

<p>In 2016, it&#39;s absolutely vital for a brand to offer a mobile app. More importantly, it&#39;s critical that any released mobile apps are the best they could possibly be. After all, so many other companies are providing mobile experiences that consumers can pick and choose the brands that offer the greatest apps.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/No-one-ever-said-app-development-had-to-be-difficult-and-expensive.jpg"/></p>

<p>It&#39;s time to create an amazing mobile app if your organization hasn&#39;t. This is the only way to engage your existing customers and clients as well as attract new ones that have yet to interact with your brand.</p>

<p>But you aren&#39;t an app developer. You don&#39;t know where to start.</p>

<h2>Economic feasibility</h2>

<p>The best place to begin when creating a mobile app is with <a href="https://www.clickz.com/2016/01/26/show-me-the-money-proving-your-mobile-site-or-app-will-deliver-roi">an economic feasibility report</a>, according to Andy Favell of ClickZ. He explained that one such report contains a detailed list of the pros of offering a mobile app, an analysis of the cost of doing so and a time when you will receive a return on investment for the project. For example, the benefits of a project would be brand awareness, lead generation, more sales, boosted loyalty or getting more customers into stores.</p>

<p>When it comes to cost, you must calculate the price of building and promoting your app-to-be. According to Favell, Magnus Jern, president of DMI International, said that expenses could run as low as free and as high as $50 million, but when breaking it down, it&#39;s best to focus on these numbers:</p>

<ul><li>Help from an outside developer can run about $1,000 per day, said Jern.</li><li>A single internal developer costs approximately $550 each day, while someone to integrate development and support systems would run around $800 for a day of work.</li></ul>

<p>Of course, with external developers, brands have more flexibility, and therefore aren&#39;t spending $1,000 every day, but rather on a project-by-project basis. This is an important factor to note when considering the economic feasibility of an app development initiative. Opting for a consulting partner could make a strategy more affordable.</p>

<blockquote><p>Most brands earn $500,000 with their mobile apps in the first six months.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there&#39;s the ROI, which can be determined based on the already-outlined benefits of providing a mobile app. Simply put, what is the optimal outcome of offering the app? Favel cited Jern&#39;s analysis, which indicated that most brands earn $500,000 thanks to their mobile apps in the first six months after launching them.</p>

<p>Of course, you must also consider the cost of supporting your app. Tools from Xamarin, via certified partners or direct, can help keep that investment as low as possible, as TechTarget explained that it has <a href="http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Xamarin-Platform-A-mobile-application-development-tool">a variety of add-ons</a> that will allow your company to manage apps throughout their lifecycle.</p>

<h2>Technological feasibility</h2>

<p>Citing data collected by Standish Group, a second blog post on ClickZ by Favell reported that <a href="https://www.clickz.com/2016/01/19/how-to-assess-the-feasibility-of-your-mobile-project">around 26 percent of mobile app development projects</a> go over their budgets, are late or have &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; outcomes, while 5 percent of them are never completed. As such, Favell recommended determining the technical feasibility of creating an app: Can your brand handle it and how?</p>

<p>Answering this question might seem easy, but consider what&#39;s riding on the success of your mobile app and how you really need to release a five-star app. Most brands simply don&#39;t have the skills and technologies in-house that are required to develop a great app. That isn&#39;t a knock on some companies, but rather a consistent truth for businesses with other priorities and less than massive developer teams.</p>

<p>Your mobile app creation solution lies in external help and a mobile app development platform such as Xamarin, again offered via those value-add consulting partners. This will ensure that deadlines are met, the end results are optimal and app users are happy. This approach also keeps budgets in check and will help you create and subsequently release your app more quickly – both of which are especially important nowadays.</p>

<p>Writing for Forbes, AJ Agrawal provided some tips for choosing a mobile app software developer. For one, you should always try out some of the apps that firm has created for clients. Look for a success story or two, and then download one of those apps. Next, check out social media for some client testimonials, Agrawal recommended. This way, you&#39;ll hear both sides of the story.</p>

<p>Agrawal explained that &quot;agility&quot; and &quot;transparency&quot; are two aspects of mobile app developers that you should keep an eye out for. After all, you want your brand&#39;s app to be completed fast, but you also want it created in your vision.</p>

<p>After checking out some developers, including their past experiences, similar projects, agility and technologies, you need to pin down which mobile app development platform best suits your needs. In that regard, you should check out Xamarin. This platform lives in the cloud and provides its users with everything they need to create, launch and support a native mobile app cost-effectively. TechTarget specifically highlighted the Xamarin Test Cloud, which will come in handy when you need to test your company&#39;s app on a variety of operating systems and devices and in a number of different end-user conditions.</p>

<p>Creating a mobile app doesn&#39;t have to be hard or expensive, and as long as you know where to start when it&#39;s time to build your app, it won&#39;t be.</p><hr /><h1>Wearables adoption on the rise along with security concerns</h1>

<p>Wearable technology shows tons of promise: Consumers can use smartwatches for completing retail transactions with mobile payment apps; banks can provide wearable apps for account management; and security purposes and corporations can arm their employees with quick and easy access to enterprise applications thanks to a variety of different devices. Many individuals realize this potential, and as such, wearables are slowly but surely becoming everyday technologies for many American shoppers and workers.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/Smartwatches-will-soon-be-the-payment-method-of-choice-if-brands-and-banks-can-shore-up-security-concerns.jpg"/></p>

<p>According to an analysis conducted by eMarketer in October 2015, <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Wearable-Usage-Will-Grow-by-Nearly-60-This-Year/1013159">almost 40 million American citizens</a> over the age of 18 have used either a smartwatch – such as the Apple Watch – or a fitness tracker – like the Fitbit. While that might only be around 16 percent of adults in the U.S., adoption rates of wearables have more than doubled in the past year alone. And eMarketer forecasts even more growth in 2016, predicting that around 64 million Americans will own a wearable device by the end of this year.</p>

<p>When it comes to smart wearables specifically – those that are similar to the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear and even the Oculus Rift – IDC estimated that <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25519615">there will be 38 million of them</a> shipped to retail stores and ecommerce sites in 2016 alone, but that was based on 2014&#39;s numbers. Therefore, it&#39;s likely that upwards of 70 million Americans will have a wearable wrapped around their wrists by the beginning of 2017.</p>

<blockquote><p>Around 64 million Americans will own a wearable device by the end of this year.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Many devices, many attack vectors</h2>

<p>While the future certainly is bright for wearables and the apps that run on them, cybersecurity is a major concern – or at least it should be for both brands and consumers. For one thing, with almost 70 million new devices connected to the Internet, there are 70 million new attack vectors that hackers can exploit. Secondly, wearables are likely to play a key role in the adoption of mobile payment services, which means that they&#39;ll have access to a wealth of payment card data and other personal information. Doug Pollack, chief security officer at ID Experts, <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/top-privacy-security-predictions-2016">explained these sentiments</a> in a blog post on HealthcareITNews.</p>

<p>&quot;I see the explosion of wearable devices as a likely new area for potential privacy concerns,&quot; Pollack said, according to the source. &quot;Just as with mobile devices, wearables are likely to expose new security threats, while getting real-time access to new types of data about individuals that has not been captured before. Especially as new applications are deployed on these devices, there will be unintended consequences when it comes to the protection and privacy of the user&#39;s personal data.&quot;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/14122115.jpg"/></p>

<p>In fact, We Live Security&#39;s Stephen Cobb listed <a href="http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/12/08/wearables-wheres-the-risk/">all of the ways</a> that hackers can steal data when wearables are involved. Some of those attack vectors are inherent in the age of connectivity, such as Bluetooth connections, Wi-Fi and 4G, but other components of wearables will also introduce vulnerabilities: apps, app analytics systems, device firmware, Web browsers, APIs and even the backend infrastructure supporting them, such as the cloud. Or, a hacker could just steal a device.</p>

<h2>Time to get innovative with cybersecurity</h2>

<p>Therefore – and this is obvious – brands that hope to offer a wearable mobile app must take cybersecurity seriously. This is only exacerbated when businesses and banks are developing mobile payment apps for these devices.</p>

<p>Experts recommend investing in end-to-end encryption, and this is a great approach. But security is multi-layered, and one solution isn&#39;t likely to solve all wearable cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Encryption isn&#39;t going to prevent fraud or stop hackers from taking control of wearable devices remotely. As such, brands and developers need to get help from experienced partners to inject innovative security strategies into their wearable and payment app initiatives.</p>

<h2>But don&#39;t forget the end user</h2>

<p>PaymentsSource contributor Alex Bray asserted that <a href="http://www.paymentssource.com/news/paythink/wearables-are-the-new-catalyst-for-a-new-payments-tech-wave-3023138-1.html">retailers and banks</a> should focus on seamless customer experiences when approaching wearable security. These devices have capabilities built in that could make securing personal data easier than some think. For example, Bray highlighted geolocational features as a means of protecting payment data. This would entail verifying consumers&#39; physical locations or proximity to other devices before transactions are approved. That way, end users don&#39;t have to do anything themselves.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s biometric security, which can perform multiple authentication techniques to guarantee the identity of a user. PSFK reported on Nymi, a new smart wearable that relies on <a href="http://www.psfk.com/2016/01/mastercard-wearable-technology-seamless-payments-digital-security-trends.html">consumers&#39; fingerprints and heartbeats</a> to verify identities. While Nymi plans to replace a PIN, brands could use them in conjunction. After all, true multi-factor authentication requires something that users own – a heartbeat for example – as well as something that they know – a password.</p>

<p>If brands and banks hope to have high adoption rates when it comes to their wearable apps, then they need to invest in strong cybersecurity. Often this falls out of the scope of a typical development team, but that&#39;s where trusted partners can help. After all, companies shouldn&#39;t expect to revolutionize mobile and wearable security when their core competencies are in different sectors.</p><hr /><p><a href="/blog/archive.html" class="buttonLink" style="float: right;">Archive <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></p>
