<h1>Mobile shopping isn&#39;t stopping</h1>

<p>&#39;Tis the season for mobile shopping. According to TechCrunch, which cited data from Adobe, consumers used their mobile devices <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/thanksgiving-online-sales/#.ksj0q7:CcOb">to spend $1.5 billion in only two days</a> at the beginning of the holiday buying spree. Additionally, 54 percent of all Black Friday traffic came from smartphones and tablets, and individuals completed over a third of their transactions on those same devices. As the new year approaches, mobile shopping will continue to dominate the retail industry.</p>

<p><em>&quot;46.7% of commerce traffic comes from smartphones.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Into 2016, there is no reason to suspect that consumers will abandon their new, more efficient methods for finding deals and completing purchases. TechCrunch explained that smartphones are now the most popular shopping channel, pointing to an IBM report that said 46.7 percent of commerce traffic - throughout the whole year - comes from those devices.</p>

<p><strong>Apps are the new shopping tool</strong><br/>More importantly, it seems that consumers love mobile retail apps. SimilarWeb found that since the beginning of the week of Thanksgiving, the biggest U.S. retailers&#39; apps experience a massive spike in use - an average boost of <a href="http://www.similarweb.com/blog/holiday-shopping-season-heralds-the-year-of-the-app">60 percent more active users</a> throughout &quot;peak shopping season.&quot; Meanwhile, Web traffic dropped, which further supports the point that mobile apps are the de facto standard for at least browsing product inventory and hopefully completing transactions.</p>

<p><strong>The modern path to purchase</strong><br/>The bottom line is that today&#39;s consumers are using their mobile devices at all points throughout their path to purchase. CNBC reported that the solution for brands is to release mobile apps that give consumers &quot;a tool that <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/09/retail-apps-becoming-more-popular-with-shoppers.html">enriches their shopping experience</a>.&quot; That&#39;s because mobile apps now play a critical role in buying, whether consumers are clicking complete transaction or simply searching an app for a price.</p>

<p>Mobile apps cannot just provide a singular function if they hope to remain relevant in the modern commerce market. Instead, they must engage consumers with multiple functionalities that contribute to the entire shopping experience.</p>

<p>Take data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, for example. This group surveyed a wide range of consumers and discovered that 44 percent of millennials <a href="http://www.iab.com/news/critical-differences-in-digital-shopping-habits-between-age-groups-identified-by-iab-report/">want to read product reviews</a> on their smartphones and 42 percent want to check prices. Meanwhile, older groups - those aged between 35 and 54 years - are more likely to seek out physical store locations and their hours on their smartphones. Apart from those use cases, consumers are likely to use retails apps to redeem coupons or share products with social media.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.syrinx.com/media/06320ed4-4f81-4d18-8d4f-45d509c0f959/img/3340/14120078.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>Purchasing fails</strong><br/>If anything, the last area to conquer with respect to mobile app use cases is actual purchasing. Re/code reported that many shoppers struggle to buy items or services with mobile apps, as it cited ChannelAdvisor data: Conversion rates on smartphones <a href="http://recode.net/2015/11/27/its-officially-time-to-freak-out-if-your-mobile-shopping-site-sucks/">are half as high</a> as they are on desktops - at 2.16 percent and 5.33 percent respectively. So, while mobile shopping isn&#39;t stopping anytime soon, retailers need to make them more useful during the entire customer experience.</p>

<p>In that regard, adding mobile payment capabilities to a retail app could make those apps that much more valuable to consumers during the moment of truth. After all, people are already using apps throughout their journeys, but they&#39;re stopping short when it comes to actual transactions.</p>

<p>Companies such as Cumberland Farms have already discovered the benefits of integrating payment features into their retail apps, and if brands want to experience a similar increase in sales and success, then following pre-established strategies is a best bet. To add extra incentive, retailers could also inject their rewards programs into their mobile apps - which Cumberland Farms did as well.</p>

<p>Mobile shopping is modern shopping. As such, retailers must ensure that their mobile apps can offer consumers something at every point of their buying journeys, and the last step is adding payment capabilities.</p><hr /><h1>Into 2016: Mobile payment app market in perspective</h1>

<p>The mobile payment app market has come a long way in the past 12 months. Standing on the precipice to 2016, it&#39;s apparent that no brand plans on slowing down. Even more, some businesses are even considering entering the mobile payments arena in the new year. In fact, 2016 is a great time to begin creating a mobile marketing strategy and developing a mobile payment app in tandem.</p>

<p><strong>An open market</strong><br/>Simply put, despite all the competition in the news, no brand has truly seized the mobile payment app market. This is plenty of room for competition since not everyone is using them yet.</p>

<p><em>&quot;64% of mobile device owners haven&#39;t used a mobile payment app yet.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Retale conducted a survey at the beginning of November and found that 64 percent of mobile device owners <a href="http://www.retale.com/corporate/survey-56-want-to-use-mobile-pay-when-shopping-this-holiday-season/">haven&#39;t used a mobile payment app</a> to purchase goods and services in person. However, the firm also discovered that 56 percent of respondents would use one of those apps during the 2015 holiday season.</p>

<p>&quot;Though the majority of shoppers have yet to use mobile pay, they do see it as an increasingly useful way to pay in-store, particularly during busy shopping periods,&quot; said Pat Dermody, president of Retale, in a press release statement. &quot;For retailers interested in bridging the gap between online and offline, mobile may offer a solution.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that consumers are interested in mobile payments apps, but they haven&#39;t found the best one for their needs in 2015. Therefore, any brand could find success in 2016. And if that&#39;s not convincing enough for a business, it should consider this: Target <a href="http://www.mobilecommercepress.com/target-to-develop-its-own-mobile-payments-platform/8520326/">plans to launch a mobile payment app</a> in the new year, according to Mobile Commerce Press.</p>

<p><strong>Current users</strong><br/>As millennials get older and more financially secure, they are likely to rapidly adopt mobile payment apps. Or at least that&#39;s what Payment Week reported. According to the source, Ernst and Young released a study that identified the majority of consumers using mobile payment apps as &quot;<a href="http://paymentweek.com/2015-12-29-ey-study-millennials-pushing-mobile-payments-technology-9239/">younger, urban and wealthy.&quot;</a> Therefore, a retail or banking branded mobile payment app could become a major cultural trend among millennials and city dwellers in the new year.</p>

<p>That said, perhaps the best aspect of the current mobile payment app user base is that they leverage them for all types of transactions. According to Retale, in the first months of 2016, 27 percent of consumers will use these apps for buying food, 24 percent for clothing, 17 percent for gas and 13 percent for electronics.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.syrinx.com/media/06320ed4-4f81-4d18-8d4f-45d509c0f959/img/3340/14120078.jpg"/></p>

<p>Current mobile payment appÂ users have the potential to make those tools very trendy in 2016, while the wide number of use cases could help brands get their apps in a lot of different hands.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation isn&#39;t done yet</strong><br/>There is still plenty of room for innovative mobile payment apps and there&#39;s definitely space in the market to introduce unique features. Take Walmart&#39;s mobile payment service, for example, which uses QR codes instead of NFC chips. Meanwhile, Apple supports Apple Pay on its smartwatch, and according to CNBC, Samsung Pay will allow consumers to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/29/samsung-pay-plans-to-enable-us-online-shopping-in-2016.html">pay for products and services on online channels</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;For Samsung, moving online could be a smart move,&quot; James Wester, research director of global payments at IDC Financial Insights, told the source. &quot;It will help them build customer habit and they can benefit from that when U.S. consumers transact in stores.&quot;</p>

<p>Apart from that, brands such as Cumberland Farms have integrated rewards systems into their mobile apps, following the path that Starbucks took to user adoption. While it might sound like everything has been done, this merely suggests that there are still innovative ways to make mobile payment apps more interesting - they just haven&#39;t been discovered yet.</p>

<p>Heading into 2016, businesses should start formulating a plan to seize the mobile payment market, as it&#39;s clearly ripe for the picking.</p><hr /><h1>4 ways to prevent branded mobile apps from getting deleted</h1>

<p>Developing a mobile app might be a popular way to attract and retain customers, but it certainly isn&#39;t easy. Brands must acquire the personnel, a platform and roadmap before they even begin on their mobile app development journeys. This is obviously pretty challenging for organizations that have never ventured into this arena before. That said, there are always opportunities to partner with experienced third-party firms to ensure that apps are created and released in a timely and efficient manner.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to getting consumers to use a mobile app, there isn&#39;t much help available. In fact, many brands have no idea how to guarantee that consumers download their app. More challenging than that, enterprises must inspire users to keep their mobile app installed. After all, deleting apps is second nature for consumers.</p>

<p><em>&quot;20% of users remove mobile apps from their devices after three months.&quot;</em></p>

<p>According to Computer Business Review Online, a 34SP survey of U.K. mobile users found that <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/news/mobility/apps/apps-miss-the-mark-on-consumer-expectations-4648325">20 percent of those individuals</a> remove mobile apps from their smartphones and tablets after three months. Additionally, The Drum reported on a study that discovered <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/02/27/84-consumers-have-deleted-branded-apps-after-only-one-use-finds-research-ampersand">84 percent of that same demographic</a> only use mobile apps once before uninstalling them. It&#39;s pretty clear that users are picky, hard to please and quick to react when it comes to mobile apps.</p>

<p>Here are four ways brands can prevent their mobile apps from getting deleted.</p>

<p><strong>1. Make it intuitive</strong><br/>Apple introduced the world to mobile device simplicity and intuitiveness, and since then, that&#39;s all consumers want out of their mobile apps. Apadmi found that 56 percent of U.K. mobile users believe that branded appsÂ <a href="http://www.apadmi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/retail-app-report-november-2015.pdf">could function &quot;better,&quot;</a> while 43 percent indicated that they wished mobile payment apps were &quot;easier&quot; to use. Simply put, enterprises must listen to those individuals and deliver a mobile app that abandons frills and thrills, replacing them with clean user interfaces and simple ways to complete activities.</p>

<p>In an interview with Forbes, Suzanne Noble, founder and CEO of Frugl, recommended <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2015/12/01/what-you-need-to-know-to-create-a-successful-app-on-a-shoestring/">removing distractions</a> and making it easy to navigate menus as well as accomplish goals - such as buying an item or looking up product information.</p>

<p><strong>2. Launch glitch- and bug-free</strong><br/>Brands are struggling to release mobile apps as fast as possible in hopes of striking the iron while it&#39;s hot with respect to the app craze, and this is actually hurting these enterprises in the long run. When companies rush to complete apps on a fixed schedule, bugs and glitches are often left behind in the code, and those issues inspire users to send apps to the recycle bin. According to a Dynatrace report cited by NBC News, 75 percent of consumers with mobile devices asserted that they delete retail apps <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/cyber-monday-trial-fire-many-retailers-websites-n471341">if they crash, have bugs or just under-perform</a>.</p>

<p>The solution here is simple, but not enough organizations engage with this best practice: Mobile app testing. Using cloud services or tools, mobile app developers can identify bugs, glitches and other issues while they develop, but most importantly, before they launch those apps.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.syrinx.com/media/06320ed4-4f81-4d18-8d4f-45d509c0f959/img/3340/14120080.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>3. Offer usefulness</strong><br/>There are so many mobile apps on the market and available for free that brands need to differentiate themselves from others, while still retainingÂ useful tools for completing transactions, looking up product information and generally interacting with their favorite companies. Computer Business Review Online noted that 39 percent of U.K. mobile users who deem an app as &quot;useless&quot; will drop it in the trash.</p>

<p>Brands also need to ensure that their app provides more than just a single functionality. According to Apadmi, 27 percent of U.K. consumers with mobile devices want to do more than simply look up products and buy them.</p>

<p>Mobile apps don&#39;t need to be unique snowflakes as much as they must be powerful tools for completing a few different activities. This way, there is always a task that consumers could use an app for. So, for mobile payment apps, this might mean providing users with the ability to do more than just pay - the app could allow customers to check balances, transfer funds and more. Meanwhile, a retail app should include some social features.</p>

<p><strong>4. Provide value, incentives or rewards</strong><br/>The best way to keep users engaged and inspired to keep a mobile app is to provide actual value in the form of incentives and rewards. Apadmi explained that 34 percent of U.K. mobile device owners want apps to grant them special offers or at least allow them to accrue points in a loyalty program.</p>

<p>Therefore, retailers, banks and more should integrate existing rewards cards and promotional campaigns into their mobile apps. As a tip, brands should leverage mobile device notifications to frequently remind their users of discounts and offers. However, those features must work, so no organization should skimp on skilled developers and testers.</p>

<p>Getting consumers to keep a branded mobile app on their devices should be a high priority, and this is especially particular for companies in competitive sectors where offering an engaging app is a business differentiator.</p><hr /><p><a href="/blog/archive.html" class="toAchive">Archive <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></p>
