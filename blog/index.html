<h1>What Does The Microsoft-Xamarin News Mean For Brands With Mobile Apps?</h1>

<p>Consumers demand apps, and businesses keep supplying them, but many companies are struggling to maintain such a fast pace when it comes to mobile app development. After all, there are a lot of moving parts that must line up perfectly to develop an app in a traditional sense with all the bells and whistles – dedicated native developers, development tools, backend systems, testing environments and more. That is one of the major reasons why brands today are turning to rapid mobile app development.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/Microsoft-agreed-to-acquire-Xamarin-and-the-results-could-be-great-for-businesses-using-that-mobile-app-development-platform_1947_40113884_0_14121249_500-320x200.jpg"/></p>

<p>With approaches that entail quickly creating high-performing and great-looking apps, businesses are able to release their apps faster, which means generating a return on those investments sooner. But rapid mobile app development isn&#39;t just a strategy. It requires a solution: a mobile app development platform that provides frameworks and APIs for creating custom apps. That tool must also, however, allow developers to code apps that support all mobile device operating systems.</p>

<p>Enter Xamarin. This rapid mobile development platform is invaluable in 2016. It ensures that brands can build, test and support apps throughout their entire lifecycles thanks to a coding language called C#. That code is automatically converted to native code for each mobile OS via a hosted .NET environment. With Xamarin quick cross-platform development gets simpler. Third-party app development firms take advantage of these tools, and the results are great. It&#39;s because Xamarin allows developers to create any app they want – Xamarin supports apps, such as JetBlue&#39;s, as well as mobile games such as Bastion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Xamarin rapid mobile development platform is invaluable in 2016.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>In the news</strong></p>

<p>Recently, Microsoft announced that its has <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/02/24/microsoft-to-acquire-xamarin-and-empower-more-developers-to-build-apps-on-any-device/">agreed to acquire Xamarin</a>. This might sound surprising, but Ars Technica&#39;s Peter Bright reported that this partnership has been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/microsoft-at-last-buys-net-for-ios-android-vendor-xamarin/">a long time coming</a>. As the source explained, Xamarin was a spin-off company of Ximian , which originally created Mono – an open source version of .NET. And Microsoft released the first .NET in the 2000s as a way to develop cross-platform apps. Once Xamarin began its life as a tech firm, it started to finish Mono. Therefore, Bright asserted, technically speaking, Xamarin finished what Microsoft started years ago – it&#39;s come full circle.</p>

<p>Then, in the past few years, Microsoft and Xamarin partnered to integrate Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio with the rapid mobile development platform, Bright wrote. In 2014, the relationship grew strong when Microsoft made .NET partially open source, giving Xamarin better support for .NET. So, historically, the partnership between Microsoft and Xamarin has yielded good results.</p>

<p>In that regard, many industry experts think that the acquisition is promising. More importantly, it reflects how important cross-platform mobile app development really has become. Microsoft understands that app development must improve across the board, and it wants to be in on the ground floor of innovation. WIRED&#39;s Klint Finley supported that thinking, clearing the air around <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/microsoft-expands-empire-beyond-windows-xamarin-buy/">what exactly this acquisition means</a> for the underlying Xamarin platform and other backend services. The good news, Finely explained, is that this wasn&#39;t a case of absorbing key players from Xamarin and throwing away the rest – a process known in the industry as &quot;acquihiring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is definitely not an acquihire,&quot; Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft&#39;s cloud and enterprise group, told the source. &quot;There are more than 300 people on the Xamarin team. We very much view this acquisition as an opportunity to take what they&#39;ve built and make it a core part of our strategy.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The impact of it all</strong></p>

<p>Therein lies the question for many brands looking into Xamarin right now as a solution for mobile app development. If these companies already have a plan to leverage the platform with help from a third-party development, will anything change? No, but also yes.</p>

<p>For one, out of this deal, Microsoft gets some benefits, yet the acquisition isn&#39;t likely to change Xamarin or mobile app development for a while. For ZDNet, Forrester Vice President and Principal Analyst Jeffrey Hammond and Principal Analyst Michael Facemire wrote that the mobile backend as a service aspect of Xamarin could soon live on Microsoft&#39;s Azure public cloud service infrastructure.</p>

<p>When it comes to businesses that want to use Xamarin, the Forrester analysts asserted that this acquisition makes the mobile development platform more attractive. Now, &quot;mainstream buyers&quot; have no reason to be concerned about using a cloud service from a smaller provider, they argued, and since few mobile developers &quot;are comfortable with the current status quo,&quot; they now have a great option.</p><hr /><h1>Full-Stack Developers Aren&#39;t Required To Build Great Mobile Apps</h1>

<p>Nowadays, a mobile app needs to provide it all. It must have a great user interface that provides consumers with a variety of features and capabilities while avoiding the complexities that can come with too many options. Beyond that, a mobile app has to ensure it&#39;s bug- and glitch-free, as well as perform optimally, regardless of the devices it&#39;s opened on or the other apps running in the background. It should offer something that is unique, such as a loyalty or rewards program, as that can keep users engaged and frequently interacting. And perhaps most importantly, a mobile app must seamlessly connect with existing accounts to provide a personalized experience.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/Many-brands-turn-to-fullstack-developers-for-mobile-app-development-but-those-skilled-professionals-are-really-required-to-build-great-apps_1947_40114323_0_14082805_500-320x200.jpg"/></p>

<p>That probably sounds like a lot, but in the extremely competitive app market of 2016, overlooking a single feature, capability or end-user expectation could spell disaster – a poor review or, worse, a deleted app.</p>

<p>To build mobile apps that truly provide it all, brands should look for full-stack developers. Those are IT employees who &quot;understand <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3038679/application-development/the-13-developer-skills-you-need-to-master-now.html">the implications of technical decisions</a> from core layers of software onto the presentation layer,&quot; as Hossein Rahnama, founder and chief product officer at Flybits, explained to InfoWorld. Full-stack developers can work on the backend, integrating APIs into a mobile app&#39;s code one day, and the next, they&#39;re able to turn around and improve the end-user experience. No wonder Rahnama called these individuals &quot;great assets&quot;: In today&#39;s cross-platform mobile app market that demands native experiences, brands want full-stack developers to bring their apps to every mobile platform while maintaining high-quality.</p>

<blockquote><p>Overlooking a single end-user expectation could spell disaster in app development.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>No full-stack developers for you</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, finding a developer or IT professional with the traits for their full-stack fluent peers proves difficult. Randstad Technologies Group President of Technology and Engineering Robert Dickey said that full-stack developers are some of the <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3014161/careers-staffing/10-hot-it-job-skills-for-2016.html#slide3">most wanted IT employees in 2016</a>, according to CIO magazine. After all, individuals with wide skill sets in the back-end and front-end of mobile app development likely want higher salaries and important positions.</p>

<p><strong>Solving the problem</strong></p>

<p>The best choice for businesses that want amazing apps that provide it all is to partner with organizations that specialize in mobile app development and use tools such as Xamarin that make full-stack skills obsolete.</p>

<p>Why partner with a specialized firm? Sarah Williams, contributor for Newswire, explained that the stack <a href="http://newswire.net/newsroom/blog-post/00091932-are-full-stack-web-developers-still-needed.html">is wider than ever</a>, making it difficult for brands to hire a developer on their own who understands Android and iOS development as well as how to build out and support back-end infrastructure. The &quot;full-stack&quot; only gets more complex when factoring in additional smart devices as well as must-have features such as mobile payments and loyalty and rewards system integration.</p>

<p>With a platform such as Xamarin and a mobile app development partner that has developers with a lot of experience in building apps across devices, brands don&#39;t have to worry about finding and hiring full-stack skilled professionals. Those companies can provide staff with passions in a wealth of areas, ensuring that the best UI people work on UI while the backend infrastructure is handled by someone with expertise in that regard.</p>

<p>Consumers might want to have &quot;it all&quot; with respect to their mobile apps, but brands don&#39;t need to find developers who can do it all when they can rely on partners that leverage cross-platform development tools and supply professionals that excel at what they do.</p><hr /><h1>What Does The Future Hold For Mobile Apps?</h1>

<p>Mobile apps connect consumers to everything: Their friends and family, brands and associations, news sources and gaming communities. They also allow people to shop, be entertained, speak their minds, pay for products, learn and engage in their hobbies. Mobile apps rule the world, making Steve Jobs&#39; motto &quot;There&#39;s an app for everything&quot; ring truer than ever. And they are not going away anytime soon.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/In-order-to-keep-consumers-engaged-on-mobile-devices-brands-will-need-to-ensure-their-apps-are-up-to-date-with-the-latest-features_1947_40114058_0_14118194_500-320x200.jpg"/></p>

<p>Mobile apps have become so ingrained in modern life that no one can picture themselves not using apps on a daily basis. In fact, it&#39;s just the opposite. According to Localytics, <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/new-study-reveals-what-app-users-want-localytics">92 percent of consumers</a> said that they will use either the same number of apps or more of them in the future. They&#39;re too valuable to put away.</p>

<p>However, because mobile apps are such an important aspect of people&#39;s worlds, this market has become ultra competitive. Almost every brand has an app that – hopefully – provides something that their customers desire – an experience or an ability. And if a business doesn&#39;t have a mobile app, one is likely in the pipeline. This has caused mobile app developers and marketers to inject some innovation into their apps. After all, consumers want unique tools and to engage in the latest trends.</p>

<blockquote><p>Consumers want unique tools and to engage in the latest trends.</p></blockquote>

<p>The world is ready for the future of apps. But what do the next few months and years hold for them? Let&#39;s take a look.</p>

<p><strong>Payment technologies</strong></p>

<p>Apple, Samsung, Google, PayPal, Walmart, Chase and many more brands are pursuing mobile payments as a means of app innovation. Their goal is simple: To make wallets digital. But as CIO magazine&#39;s Sharon Goldman explained, not even one of the biggest competitors in the mobile payments space has demonstrated a mastery and cultivated a massive user base. Time will tell who will win the mobile payment apps wars, but one thing is clear: We don&#39;t know which brand will seize market share.</p>

<p>Rajul Rana, chief technology officer and partner at Liquidhub, told Goldman that &quot;there <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3037086/payment-processing/apple-google-samsung-and-others-betting-on-mobile-payments.html">can be multiple winners</a>.&quot; Rana asserted that it&#39;s up to consumers and they will choose the brands with a mobile payment app that provides the most &quot;value.&quot; In that regard, Capgemini Vice President of Consulting Bill Lewis outlined the three criteria on which these apps will be judged: &quot;security, ease-of-use and loyalty.&quot; The future of apps will certainly include mobile payments, and every brand with this feature must ensure they can meet those three demands.</p>

<p><strong>Streaming apps</strong></p>

<p>In late November 2015, Google stated that Android devices will be able to stream apps, prompting Jan Dawson, founder and chief analyst at Jackdaw, to assert that this could be <a href="https://techpinions.com/google-and-the-future-of-apps/42412">the future of apps</a> in a post on Tech.pinions. Brands should imagine a world where consumers don&#39;t need to actually download apps to interact with them. For one, this means that apps better perform amazingly. More importantly, this indicates that apps will remain one of the best ways for brands to offer experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Notifications</strong></p>

<p>Mobile apps are increasingly becoming mere conduits through which consumers receive information. In other words, people aren&#39;t using apps as much as they&#39;re installing them for the sake of notifications.</p>

<p>&quot;There are so many apps which don&#39;t really ever need to be opened, because all we use them for is notifications and quick actions in response to them,&quot; Dawson wrote.</p>

<p>As a result, brands must add new features to their mobile apps that allow users to complete actions straight from the notifications bar.</p>

<p><strong>Complete integration</strong></p>

<p>Virtual and augmented reality are a few years away from mainstream adoption, but with so many tech companies offering wearable technology and devices like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift releasing in the coming months, it&#39;s important that businesses start planning how they will integrate with apps with those tools. Beyond that, how will brands connect their apps to the Internet of Things? This future is inevitable and therefore businesses must act soon by forming strategies for app integrations.</p>

<p><strong>Outside help</strong></p>

<p>With mobile device manufacturers and app developers innovating their respective technologies every day, it will only become more difficult for the average corporation to compete in the mobile app market. They must keep up with the latest trends, rapidly building, testing and deploying apps to ensure their customers are happy. As such, it&#39;s going to become very common for brands to seek outside help for app development in the form of cloud services and third-party partnerships. Platforms such as Xamarin can make app creation easier, while external organizations can supply the expertise necessary to build great apps.</p><hr /><p><a href="/blog/archive.html" class="buttonLink" style="float: right;">Archive <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></p>
