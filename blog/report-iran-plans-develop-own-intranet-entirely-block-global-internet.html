Though originally being comparatively open in their internet laws, the country has become increasingly restricted ever since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#39;s administration took office in 2005, despite having the 2nd largest internet presence in the Middle East at just over 20 million user, behind only Israel. The government&#39;s regulation of the internet only increased after many Iranians <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-205_162-5090788.html">used social media as their biggest tool in protesting the allegedly fixed 2009 elections</a>.</p><p>On Monday, multiple reports started being published citing the International Business Times that Iran <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/325415/20120409/iran-internet-intranet-censorhip-freedom-tehran-google.htm">intends to permanently shut down the internet and replace it with their own &quot;clean&quot; internal platform</a>. According to the IRT, Iran&#39;s minister for Information and Communications Technology, Reza Taghipour, released a statement announcing that &quot;all Internet Service Providers (ISP) should only present National Internet by August.&quot; The national intranet would replace services like Google, Gmail, and Yahoo with the country&#39;s own homegrown substitutes.</p><p>Taghipour has since denied reports that Iran plans on shutting down the internet, claiming that the statement was a hoax generated by &quot;the propaganda wing of the West&quot;. However, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/10/iran-internet-access/">he did confirm that the Middle Eastern nation does intend on developing its own national platform</a>, which they expect to launch by March 2013.</p><p>If the initial reports prove to be true, it would mark the boldest attempt yet by a country to censor and control the world wide web. Should Iran manage to successfully put their own substitute intranet in place, it could set a dangerous precedent for other authoritative states in the area who are desperately trying to block what they deem harmful to their citizens.</p><p>This story is sure to continue developing, and may become an incredibly controversial issue as we near the proposed launch date next March.</p></body></html>
