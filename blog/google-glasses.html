Users who wear the glasses, which are said to be Android based and <a href="http://9to5google.com/2012/02/06/hud-google-glasses-are-real-and-they-are-coming-soon/">expected to resemble Oakley Thumps</a>, will see an augmented reality supported by Google&#39;s numerous services to get instant information on restaurants, cars, people, or just about anything else that they can look at.</p><p>The way that it works, and the fact that it looks and sounds like it was lifted from an 80s sci-fi flick, make it incredibly fascinating. A low-res camera mounted on the front of the glasses will relay information though services like Google Maps, Google Goggles, Google Latitude, and more, and display relevant data on a screen that sits just from your eye.</p><p>The sky (or, well, Android) is the limit for what these glasses can be capable of, which made <a href="http://m.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-02/google-basically-making-whole-world-googleable">PopSci ponder some of features we&#39;d expect to see</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Overlay Google Maps onto the real world, and navigation becomes effortless. Overlay reviews and menus onto restaurant storefronts as you pass them; overlay nutritional data onto your plate as you eat; overlay purchasing info if you particularly admire your co-worker&#39;s new shoes; overlay translations of foreign signage, breaking news, hilarious kittens romping at your feet.</p></blockquote><p><img alt="Terminator Graphic" src="/assets/img/blog/terminator.jpg"></p><p>As smartglasses become popular, the world will start to seem naked and inaccessible without a glossy data layer on everything.</p><p>Obviously there are privacy concerns that come along with a product that is effectively recording the world around you,  and this <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/business/2012/02/24/critics-google-changes-threaten-privacy/xIpso7CMd143KjvlC7FyqN/story.html">wouldn&#39;t be the first time Google has been the center of controversy</a> over collecting personal information. However, with reports of the glasses&#39; pricing ranging from about $250 to $600, or about the price of a smartphone, it seems that Google isn&#39;t too worried about that issue by making the super shades priced for mass distribution.</p><p>With the tech analytics company Ovum <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/01/23/developers-favor-android-over-ios-still-deemed-risky-for-corporate-use/">reporting that developers  as a whole are already being to favor Android over iOS</a>, it seems that the market for Android developers is poised to see a major uptick as these Google glasses present an alluring opportunity for the nerdists among us.</p></body></html>
