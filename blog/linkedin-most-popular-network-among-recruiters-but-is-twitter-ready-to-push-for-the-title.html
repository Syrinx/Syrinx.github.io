Social media has proven to be the next logical step, with no other online resource providing as much connectivity or personal information.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/bullhorn2.jpg"></p><blockquote><p>Social media use by recruiters for staffing purposes.</p></blockquote><p>Bullhorn Reach, a company that develops recruiting software and services, recently released their <a href="http://www.bullhornreach.com/content/resources/reports">2012 Social Recruiting Activity Report</a>. The report compiled and analyzed data from over 35,000 Bullhorn Reach users regarding their usage and success of the &quot;Big Three&quot; social media networks for staffing purposes.</p><p>To little surprise, the report showed that 48% of recruiters use LinkedIn exclusively, getting 9 times more applications than from Facebook and 3 times more than Twitter. LinkedIn, often billed as the &quot;professional&quot; social network, encourages users to include information in their profiles that are crucial for recruiters, including job history, technical skills, interests, and more. Their well-designed advanced search feature allows you to navigate the site and discover profiles the same way you would a job board like <a href="http://www.dice.com/">Dice</a> or <a href="http://www.monster.com/">Monster</a>.</p><p>This ideal functionality made LinkedIn the first of the big three social networks to be embraced by recruiters. Bullhorn&#39;s data found that 28% of recruiters on LinkedIn, the largest segment, have over 1,000 connections on the site.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/blog/bullhorn1.jpg"></p><blockquote><p>Network sizes between the Big Three sites.</p></blockquote><p>While LinkedIn has the most hyperactive recruiter contingent, those on Twitter have the smallest networks. Bullhorn found that 35% of recruiters have between 1-10 followers, with 75% having under 100. The firm cites, however, that these numbers are due to Twitter being a recently adopted medium by the industry.</p><p>In fact, the report helps makes a case that Twitter has been the most effective as far as candidate response. Bullhorn&#39;s report states that a Twitter follower is three times more likely to apply to a job than a connection on LinkedIn is, and eight times more likely than one on Facebook. Twitter&#39;s weak search feature, however, and relative difficulty to build a large network could prove daunting for many recruiters looking to make the jump. It&#39;s interesting to note that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/social-recruiting/">while TechCrunch reported last November that 1 in 6 job seekers found their job using social media</a>, 78% of those cited Facebook as their source. Despite this, recruiters are joining Facebook at the lowest rate of the Big Three.</p><p>With Twitter providing the greatest returns, and LinkedIn seeing the most activity, cross referencing that with the findings in the TechCrunch report raise some good questions: Who&#39;s currently looking in the wrong place, the recruiters or the seekers? Can this be remedied? And if not, is there a job hunting service that can provide the appeal of social media&#39;s transparency?</p></article></main><div class="shim reversed"></div><aside><h1>Have a project we can help with?</h1><a href="/contact">Talk To Us <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></aside><div class="shim"></div><footer><nav><a href="/services">Services</a> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> <a href="/company">Company</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> <a href="/contact">Contact</a></nav><p id="social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-facebook-official"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://medium.com/@SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-medium"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/syrinx-consulting-corporation"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p><p>Copyright &copy; 2016 Syrinx Consulting Corporation.
