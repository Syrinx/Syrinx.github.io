As for HTML5, it allows developers to move past the clunky, antiquated functionality of its predecessor.</p><p><em>&quot;Shoppers want checkout to be fast and consistent.&quot;</em></p><p>So, why would you create an e-commerce website with Node.js serving the back end and HTML5 serving the front end? Is the approach the same as our take on building mobile apps?</p><p><strong>Listen to the shoppers </strong><br>Before diving into the benefits of using HTML5 and Node.js to construct an e-commerce site, it&#39;s important to assess what consumers want. On the surface level, people desire easy navigability, a quick way to access information and a checkout process that doesn&#39;t take 10 minutes to complete. From a more granular perspective, PrestaShop&#39;s Natalie Biegel <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-top-10-things-customers-are-looking-for-on-your-e-commerce-site/">noted several factors that influence</a> shopper behavior:</p><ul><li>Studies have shown that the majority of consumers leave websites after waiting more than 3 seconds for them to load. Yes, bandwidth, RAM and other elements can dictate how fast a page loads, but backend data communication management is also a factor.</li><li>Everybody loves a deal, and e-commerce customers are no exception. Furthermore, promotions and discounts must be applicable to a shopper&#39;s interests. In a survey of 1,100 consumers conducted by MyBuys, 39 percent of respondents said they <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/charts/2013/10235/personalized-marketing-drives-buyer-readiness-and-sales">purchase more from merchants</a> that deliver personalized item recommendations.</li><li>If a person is browsing for items online, he or she is likely a frequent social media user. It&#39;s not uncommon for people to share listings for cool products on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other websites.</li></ul><p>From a development standpoint, we can glean a few insights from these considerations. First, time is of the essence - a necessity that can be met with certain functions offered by Node.js. Second, the website must deliver relevant ads to online shoppers, which suggests that integration with Google DoubleClick for Publishers, a CRM solution and other applications is needed. Third, connecting to social media platform APIs through HTML5 is essential.</p><p><img alt="HTML5 can provide the front-end functionality customers favor. " src="http://pictures.brafton.com/x_0_0_0_14098671_800.jpg">HTML5 can provide the front-end functionality customers favor.</p><p><strong>Giving the website its juice  </strong><br>One beneficial component of Node.js is how it communicates with other platforms. Readwrite contributor Lauren Orsini noted that Node.js runs JavaScript <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-nodejs">by employing Google&#39;s V8</a>. What V8 does is enable Node.js to translate JavaScript into native machine language as opposed to converting it into bytecode, so this subverts one of the conventional communication slowdowns.</p><p>Bouncing off V8&#39;s integration, a signature benefit is Node.js&#39; ability to sanction asynchronous communications. It leverages a capability known as the Event Loop, which allows data to be transmitted whenever it&#39;s available. That means the latency caused by a client requesting services from the server (in this case, the consumer uploading an e-commerce website) is reduced.</p><p><em>&quot;We&#39;d recommended creating a map of which APIs will connect to HTML5.&quot;</em></p><p><strong>Working well with others </strong><br>As developers, we&#39;d recommended creating a map of which APIs connect which applications, and how this overarching compatibility will impact your e-commerce site&#39;s performance. To keep things simple, let&#39;s assume your ad server is connected to Google DoubleClick for Publishers.</p><p>Connecting a DoubleClick exit (i.e. a function that directs browsers to other Web pages when they click on ads), necessitates a two step process, according to Google support:</p><p>&quot;First, define the exit name in your HTML5 files. Then, when you upload the creative in the Studio Web UI, add a destination URL to the exit you defined.&quot;</p><p>All things considered, Node.js and HTML5 complement one another quite nicely. The former provides the horsepower needed to quickly load Web pages, while the the latter needs a limited number of plugins to give you the front-end functionality visitors appreciate.</p></article></main><div class="shim reversed"></div><aside><h1>Have a project we can help with?</h1><a href="/contact">Talk To Us <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></aside><div class="shim"></div><footer><nav><a href="/services">Services</a> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> <a href="/company">Company</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> <a href="/contact">Contact</a></nav><p id="social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-facebook-official"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://medium.com/@SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-medium"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/syrinx-consulting-corporation"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p><p>Copyright &copy; 2016 Syrinx Consulting Corporation.
