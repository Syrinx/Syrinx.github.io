The well known video-chat program is going to be <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/skype-for-windows-now-features-conversation-ads/">implementing advertisements</a> during one-on-one Skype-to-Skype audio calls. Just when we thought it couldn&#39;t get any worse with advertisements completely flooding YouTube videos, Skype decides to drop this news on us.</p><p><img alt="Skype Ads" src="/assets/img/blog/skype-conversation-ads.jpg"></p><p>Of course this is simply a brilliant marketing strategy for Skype, because not only will the company be making money off of the ads but it will also increase user subscriptions, as users who have a subscription to the site or have Skype credits will be able to chat ad-free. On a positive note, at least the ads will be silent and won&#39;t be that disturbing during audio calls.</p><p>Seeing that Skype is now owned by Microsoft, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-skype-announces-conversation-ads-20120613,0,5956658.story">CEO Steve Ballmer</a> has stated to the press that millions of users love Skype, &quot;Time will tell how much the new ad policy at Skype will change that.&quot;</p><p>A major reason that Skype became so attractive for video chatting is the fact that it&#39;s an entirely cost-free service. That free users are going to have to suffer constant advertisement interruptions which may cause many of them to begin turning away from the service rather than purchasing a subscription. There isn&#39;t any news yet whether or not the ads will be implemented on the <a href="http://smarthouse.com.au/Home_Office/Platforms/G2W4R9N4">mobile applications</a> as well, but I&#39;m sure we will find out soon enough.</p></body></html>
