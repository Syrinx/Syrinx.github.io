But why? It&#39;s a question we had to ask ourselves when developing Cumberland Farms&#39; SmartPay app.</p><p>Allowing SmartPay to share information with the company&#39;s loyalty program, inventory management system and other solutions was critical to the app&#39;s success. For one thing, when someone purchased gas via SmartPay, the inventory software could record exactly how much gas was available at the station. Take a step back, and you&#39;ll see this provides Cumberland Farms with insights into demand.</p><p>What do we see here? Fuel for business intelligence, and a strong addition to Cumberland Farms&#39; customer service portfolio. More details about how integration supported SmartPay can be found in our case study. Thanks for watching!</p></body></html>
