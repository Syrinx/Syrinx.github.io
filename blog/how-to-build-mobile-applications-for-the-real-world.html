Thought leaders, experts, and entrepreneurs convened to drive discussions on a variety of leading technology issues impacting the industry today.</p><p>With no agenda and no pre-planned format, I garnered a following on a discussion about how to successfully build mobile payment applications for the real world. In this session we discussed key components of building real-world mobile payment applications.</p><p>Factors of a successful execution and adoption of mobile applications include loyalty and incentive features, the right technology and integration, a streamlined user experience and security. We also discussed trends in terms of the types of technologies being used and the lack of unification.</p><h2>Behavior</h2><p>How do you get your consumers to adopt mobile? It&#39;s all about the incentives. Convenience is only secondary. With Cumberland Farms, the mobile app offers savings at the pump and a loyalty program with visible savings for the customer.</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>Apple is pushing the technology forward with the implementation of Apple pay and NFC touch with the biometric backup. Some companies require integration with ancient point-of-sale systems and other third party applications. The customer experience should be seamless in terms of integration, agility, and ease-of-use.</p><h2>User Experience</h2><p>The current implementation with two-factor authentication is probably the safest… it&#39;ll be so easy to transact it may feel like shoplifting: just take the items you want out of the store and you are automatically charged for them. How can it get any easier than that?!</p><h2>Security</h2><p>Consumers have concerns about the integrity of the transaction as well as who owns or has a copy of their data. The mobile applications being developed for the real-world should take a step in the right direction by using tokenization.</p><h2>NFC vs Barcode vs pin vs scan</h2><p>It is too early to predict a clear winner; the technology will have to play itself out. Then again we may be having the same conversation in 5 years…</p><h2>Balkanization</h2><p>You are likely to have several different mobile payment applications for the foreseeable future. We don&#39;t see any unification because chains don&#39;t like to share with one another or cooperatively discount together. Just accept this and develop something before you get left behind.</p><hr><p>To learn more, please visit <a href="http://www.syrinx.com">www.syrinx.com</a> and complete the Contact Us section.</p><h3>About Mass Technology Leadership Council (MassTLC)</h3><p>MassTLC is the region’s leading technology association and the premier network for tech executives, entrepreneurs, investors and policy leaders.
