Even most database administrators who are familiar with the open source solution would be hard-pressed to explain how to appropriately integrate Hadoop into an organization&#39;s back-end infrastructure and make it compatible with front-end applications.</p><p><strong>Clarifications  </strong><br>It&#39;s as easy to misunderstand Hadoop&#39;s &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; configuration as it is to mistake Linux for a free-to-use, ready-for-deployment open source desktop operating system. For example, by itself, Linux is kernel, meaning it allocates a PC&#39;s resources to other programs running on that machine, but it doesn&#39;t actually function as what programmers understand to be a complete OS. People need a Linux <em>distribution</em> to bring structure to the machines they use everyday (Ubuntu is arguably the most popular Linux distro).</p><p><em>&quot;</em>What resources does Hadoop demand of developers in charge of making it enterprise-ready?&quot;__</p><p>Although not an OS, the functionality and workflow associated with Hadoop is similar to that of the Linux kernel in that companies such as Cloudera and Hortonworks develop and release &quot;enterprise-ready&quot; distributions of the big data architecture. All too often, we&#39;ve come across enterprise leaders who view Hadoop as a ready-to-use database capable of storing, transporting and analyzing unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, but this isn&#39;t necessarily the case.</p><p>This conclusion brings up a number of questions: How do Hortonworks and Cloudera configure Hadoop to make it compatible with existing corporate systems? What resources does the technology demand of developers in charge of making it enterprise-ready?</p><p><strong>It&#39;s not necessarily complete </strong><br>Open Source Insider&#39;s Adrian Bridgwater attended the 2013 Red Hat Summit in Boston, where the event keynote speaker asked how many of the open source developer attendees &quot;<a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/open-source-insider/2013/10/is-hadoop-hard.html">had witnessed full-scale Hadoop big data implementations</a> in their business.&quot; The answer? Bridgwater guessed 10 percent of those members raised their hands. He acknowledged an explanation of Hadoop by MetaMarkets CEO Mike Driscoll, who puts the solution into perspective:</p><p>&quot;Hadoop is a foundational technology, but it is not a database, it is not an analytics environment, and it is not a visualization tool. By itself, it is not a solution for helping businesses make better decisions,&quot; said Driscoll. as quoted by Bridgwater.</p><p>Yet Hadoop is often mistaken for a database, a visualization program or an analytics environment. What about tools such as Ranger, HIVE, PIG and MapReduce? Remember that these are add-ons (some libraries, others applications) to what was once a bare-bones library. In other words, Hadoop has the capability of performing all of these functions, but it doesn&#39;t come with them without further development.</p><p><img alt="Hadoop can provide the foundations of a big data architecture. " src="http://pictures.brafton.com/x_0_0_0_14094738_800.jpg">Hadoop can provide the foundations of a big data architecture.</p><p>According to a white paper written by Indus and Axiomine, <a href="http://www.induscorp.com/sites/indus/files/uploads/adoptinghadoopintheenterprise.pdf">developing an enterprise-ready distribution</a> of Hadoop obligates you to keep security, IT infrastructure development, traditional architecture compatibility and staff instruction in mind.</p><p><strong>Security </strong><br>From a data protection standpoint, the Hadoop Distributed File System can be a bit tricky. Once an authorized user is given complete visibility over all the data within the HDFS​, he or she can view every data set within the system. So, how easy is it for a cybercriminal to masquerade as a legitimate administrator? Cloudera noted that integrating the Kerberos protocol into Hadoop <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/03/authorization-and-authentication-in-hadoop/">will establish user authentication</a> processes that are otherwise absent from Hadoop.</p><p><em>&quot;Libraries such as HIVE, PIG and RHIPE have made Hadoop more compatible.&quot;</em></p><p>Kerebos operates under an authentication model that uses &quot;tickets&quot; to verify the identities of not only servers, but users requesting access to those machines. Kerebos&#39; principles can be applied at a more granular level, specifically to tables, columns and even data cells. Truth be told, more can be said about Hadoop security - a topic that will be discussed in later articles.</p><p><strong>Co-existing with other libraries </strong><br>When it was first released, Hadoop was a Java-only framework, making it incredibly difficult for developers to integrate it into systems consisting of SQL databases, C language-based applications and other technologies. Now, libraries such as HIVE, PIG and RHIPE have made Hadoop more compatible with existing assets.</p><p>For instance, PIG accommodates programmers well-acquainted with SQL and procedural data processing pipeline languages such as SAS and R. In addition, Hadoop Streaming makes MapReduce compatible with Unix Scripts, Python, SAS and R - all of which are non-Java based programs, according to the Indus and Axiomine white paper. In conclusion, Hadoop is more flexible than it was during its inception.</p><p><em>&quot;It&#39;s preferable to partner up with a team of consultants.&quot;</em></p><p><strong>From the developer&#39;s point of view </strong><br>When integrating Hadoop into your enterprise&#39;s infrastructure, it&#39;s preferable to partner up with a team of consultants that will stay with you every step of the way. Hadoop developers aren&#39;t just programmers, they possess in-depth knowledge of system administration and algorithm construction. Although Hadoop&#39;s API compatibility has made customization and integration easier, working with authorities on the technology will help you navigate any roadblocks you may encounter.</p></article></main><div class="shim reversed"></div><aside><h1>Have a project we can help with?</h1><a href="/contact">Talk To Us <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></aside><div class="shim"></div><footer><nav><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/services">Services</a> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> <a href="/company">Company</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> <a href="/contact">Contact</a></nav><p id="social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-facebook-official"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://medium.com/@SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-medium"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/syrinx-consulting-corporation"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p><p>Copyright &copy; 2016 Syrinx Consulting Corporation.
