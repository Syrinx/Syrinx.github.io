Today, businesses in every industry face tremendous competition and fast-changing markets. Perhaps most importantly, consumers are becoming more mobile, more tech-friendly and more demanding than ever before. All of this makes software development a top-level priority for just about any organization. To this end, a third-party software consultancy is key. But what makes one software consultancy better than another? And how can a company&#39;s leaders tell the difference? Our new white paper, &quot;The Developer Difference: Finding a Partner in a Software Consultancy,&quot; aims to answer both of these questions and plenty more. To put it simply, we argue that one of the most important, valuable aspects of any software consultancy is an ability and willingness to work closely with clients to develop a genuine partnership. A partner-level software consultancy will understand its clients&#39; needs and goals in a way that a less connected service provider cannot match. The white paper delves deeper into these issues. Key sections include:</p><ul><li><strong>The partner difference</strong> - What are the benefits of finding a software consultancy that can act as a partner?</li><li><strong>Signs of quality</strong> - What features should businesses look for when evaluating software consultancy options?</li><li><strong>The importance of teamwork</strong> - Why do partnerships produce so much better results than less equal, more distant relationships?</li><li><strong>Partner relationships in action</strong> - Discover step by step exactly how a software consultancy partner will operate, from drawing up the contract proposal to assigning developers and beyond. With the information this white paper has to offer, your business will be well on its way toward finding the ideal software consultancy for your specific, unique software development goals. <a href="http://blogs.syrinx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2015/05/syrinx_finding_a_software_consultancy_whitepaper.pdf">Click here</a> to download the white paper.</li></ul></body></html>
