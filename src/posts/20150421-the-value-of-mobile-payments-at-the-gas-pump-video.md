# The Value of Mobile Payments at the Gas Pump

Transcript

Whether the price of gas is skyrocketing or plunging, drivers can't avoid the need to fill up their tanks. Gas station owners and operators can make these trips easier for consumers - and more profitable for their businesses - by integrating a mobile payment system into gas pumps' point-of-sale systems.

The benefits here are significant. This approach allows customers to pay for their gas more quickly and easily, thereby increasing revenue potential. Even more significantly, companies can establish integrated loyalty programs, which can provide a major boost to customer retention rates and brand reputation.  

As mobile payments become increasingly commonplace, an integrated gas pump POS system holds obvious appeal, and will likely become more popular in the coming months. To be effective, though, these systems must fully integrate with the fuel and business infrastructure.
