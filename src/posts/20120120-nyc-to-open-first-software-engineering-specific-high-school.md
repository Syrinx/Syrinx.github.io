# NYC to open first software engineering specific high school

![](http://www.computerclasses.org/organization_files/2878/computer_science_degree.jpg)It's no secret that the fierce demand for software engineers and programmers, whose overall employment [is expected to increase by 21%](http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm#outlook) between 2008 and 2018, has made computer science degrees highly coveted by college students and employers alike. Last year, Stanford saw a[ 40% increase in students declaring a computer science major](http://www.cio.com/article/551115/Want_a_Job_Get_a_Computer_Science_Degree), while Georgia Tech reported placing 87% of their CS undergrads in jobs. On Tuesday Engadget reported that, in response to this hot skill set, [New York City will be opening its first software engineering-centric public school](http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/17/nyc-opening-its-first-pubic-high-school-dedicated-to-software-en/) in September 2012. The school, aptly named the Academy for Software Engineering, will provide a haven for aspiring coders to get build a solid foundation of knowledge before starting their post-secondary education. Much of the school's focus is based around mitigating the barriers to entry that surround a CS education. It will be an unscreened institution, meaning that interest is the only factor considered for admittance. However, it does not consider itself a vocational school, choosing instead to accompany its software centered curriculum with academic classes that will help prepare student for a successful CS college education. Supply in this industry is desperately striving to keep up with the seemingly insatiable demand. Schools like the Academy for Software Engineering will help in improving not only the quantity, but also the quality, of programmers in the job market in order to help tame the ferocious hiring environment companies currently face. Until then, searching and screening candidates diligently and comprehensively remains the only solution in identifying and placing top talent.
