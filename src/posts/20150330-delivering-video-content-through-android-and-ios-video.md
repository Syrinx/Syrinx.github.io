# Delivering video content through Android and iOS [VIDEO]

transcript

Video can be a fantastic resource to make your applications more engaging and dynamic. So, what's the best way to deliver video for both Android and iOS apps?

For Android, you're going to want to check out the Android multimedia framework. This framework supports a wide variety of media types and allows your app to play video that's stored in the app's resources, streamed over a network connection or exists as a standalone file in the file system.

For iOS, you'll probably want to look at the YouTube Helper. This is an open source library that can create a bridge between iOS application code and YouTube's JavaScript code, giving you control over the YouTube player.

Thanks for watching. Come back soon for more videos from Syrinx Consulting.
