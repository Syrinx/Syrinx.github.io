# Apple Pay and Cumberland Farms Pay-at-the-Pump

Cumberland Farms partnered with Syrinx to deliver "a smartphone app called SmartPay that allows customers to make payments from their smartphone in return for a $0.10 per gallon discount on gasoline purchases." And now, again partnering with Syrinx, "Cumberland Farms hopes to have its pay-at-the-pump Apple Pay-compatible iOS app available in the first few months of next year, likely making it one of the first gas stations to offer Apple Pay at the pump."
