# How APIs can improve your business' cohesion [VIDEO]

TranscriptÂ 

Hi, thanks for visiting Syrinx! Wondering how APIs can promote collaboration among different departments within a single company?  

While your sales and marketing teams may use a CRM solution, those in finance are likely using accounting software. How can information within these respective systems be easily shared? If a salesperson at a car suspension manufacturer sells 12,000 units to an automotive company, it may be helpful for the business as a whole to know how much time and resources it's going to take to deliver those units.  

An API can establish a link between the operation department's resource management program and the sales team's CRM solution, and it allows managers and other professionals to more effectively measure resource allocation.  

Thanks for watching! For more information about how APIs can change the way your business operates, feel free to send us an email at techinfo@syrinx.com or call us at 1-888-579-7469.
