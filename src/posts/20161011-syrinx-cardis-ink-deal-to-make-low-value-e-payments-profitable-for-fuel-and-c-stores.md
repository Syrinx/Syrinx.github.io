# Syrinx, Cardis Ink Deal To Make Low-Value e-Payments Profitable for Fuel and C-stores

> Another Move Forward for Syrinx Consulting and Cardis, Leaders in C-Store Payments

Syrinx Consulting and Cardis International have forged a partnership to drive value in the C-Store space with a card aggregation solution and mobile commerce software service that integrates with existing payment gateways, mobile platforms, loyalty programs and POS systems.

Cardis's patented aggregation technology together with Syrinx's software strategy and development services enables multiple credit and debit transactions to be aggregated into one larger transaction thus significantly reducing associated interchange and acquiring fees.  

Jonathan E. Nierenberg, Chief Marketing Officer of Cardis International, noted, "Cardis helps bring fuel and convenience store purchases to the 21st century with our transaction aggregation technology. We are delighted to introduce our new payment technology with Syrinx Consulting. It raises the bar and sets a new standard for the industry by bringing a frictionless mobile experience to this most frequently used of retail transactions while reducing overall costs of processing. Furthermore, we anticipate applying Cardis technology to other low value payment related transactions in the QSR, gaming, content download, vending and e-commerce markets." 

Luke Howarth, President of Syrinx Consulting, commented, "Transaction costs on low value electronic payments are disproportionately high relative to the low purchase amounts within the convenience stores. The Cardis Solution not only offers more convenience to drivers, but stands to save, in aggregate, millions of dollars a year in merchant fees to convenience store owners."

"The high cost of small ticket transactions have plagued the industry for a long time, and often is the reason why some convenience stores have a threshold to meet for the usage of credit cards," stated Phil Paisnel, ex-MasterCard VP of Omni-channel Merchants and industry retail veteran.
