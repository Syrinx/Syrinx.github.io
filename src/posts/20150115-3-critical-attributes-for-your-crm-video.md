# 3 Critical Attributes For Your CRM by Syrinx

TranscriptÂ 

Hey, thanks for visiting Syrinx! Shopping around for a CRM solution? We've identified 3 critical attributes every CRM deployment should have.

Number one: customizability. Every organization is different, which means each sales and marketing department has its own unique operating model. Tailoring the CRM to fit these needs is critical to ensuring your team members adopt the solution.  

Number two: compatibility. Share the love, folks - if your CRM doesn't integrate with other solutions, it may require users to conduct manual processes that could otherwise be automated.  

Number three: applicability. We've found that industry-specific CRM iterations often perform well. In contrast, it doesn't make sense for a manufacturer to use a CRM application developed for health care companies.  

Thanks for watching! Check in next time for more enterprise software tips!
