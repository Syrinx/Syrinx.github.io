# Why is Integration an Important Part of Mobile Payments?

Transcript

If there's one thing that's needed when developing a mobile payment app, it's integration with your existing solutions. But why? It's a question we had to ask ourselves when developing Cumberland Farms' SmartPay app.  

Allowing SmartPay to share information with the company's loyalty program, inventory management system and other solutions was critical to the app's success. For one thing, when someone purchased gas via SmartPay, the inventory software could record exactly how much gas was available at the station. Take a step back, and you'll see this provides Cumberland Farms with insights into demand.  

What do we see here? Fuel for business intelligence, and a strong addition to Cumberland Farms' customer service portfolio. More details about how integration supported SmartPay can be found in our case study. Thanks for watching!
