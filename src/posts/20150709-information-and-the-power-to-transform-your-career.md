# Information and the Power to Transform Your Career

As a talented individual and part of the modern day workforce, you deserve to be informed. You deserve to be in the know about the personal and professional success that a career path can offer you. Better career information not only helps you make better decisions, but also helps you prepare for the future you want, instead of the future you get.

**And My Options Areâ€¦?**  
Ever wish you knew more about a job than the short paragraph and three generic bullet points the company put up? Same. Really understanding the ins and outs of a job can be incredibly helpful when trying to narrow down options. Apart from telling you you're qualified, job insights can brief you on whether you should be interested.

**Really Stick Out**  
Everyone eager to help you on your road to employment will be quick to tell you to make your cover letter "unique" and try to be as "different" as possible in order to "stand out" in a hyper-competitive world. Apart from these buzzwords, most people won't be able to offer much to help you create distinction. The truth is that employers want to know what you can bring to the job that others can't, and the best way to show them this is by learning as much as you can about the job and then relating it to yourself.

**Create a Career, Map Your Future**  
There's no way of knowing yours (or anybody else's) future with certainty, but there are definitely options you can take to nudge destiny on a desired path. Understanding what the career paths that you want holds for you in the long run can aid you in determining if it's the best fit, and really planning for the future.
