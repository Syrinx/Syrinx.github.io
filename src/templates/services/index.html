<h2>OUR APPROACH</h2>
<p>We invest our time by sitting down with you to discuss what problems you're encountering, what you want to accomplish, and whether we're a good fit for each other. We understand that there is a human aspect to process. From design mockups to layout, functionality, and look and feel we'll walk you through each step before coding anything. We'll also explain and map our designs and ideas to your objectives. Syrinx Consulting is a developer-founded, developer-run consulting company focused on the most efficient delivery of software engineering talent.</p>

<p>Syrinx's experienced developers are engaged in every step of the process, from the initial sales inquiry to the sourcing decisions. We take the time to understand your business and technical needs upfront, and work with senior resource managers to decide the right skill set for the job. We then send you exactly the right resources for the job, whether it's one developer or a whole team, saving you the time and hassle of interviewing, screening, and vetting technical resources. As a result, you get expertise and service tailored to your needs. Our clients trust us to deliver consistently high-quality talent, on-time and on-budget. We love what we do, and we do it well.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Applications today are more connected and distributed than ever.

In order to help secure and manage these APIs, we work with many off-the-shelf and custom solutions. Our clients look to us for help in planning, developing, and implementing distributed solutions securely and seamlessly. We also bundle best in class testing to speed up and improve quality of both design and delivery.</p>

We build apps with instantaneous information exchange amongst devices and all relevant databases; with synchronization built into the very foundation of the apps; and as such our apps delight users with an intuitive, independent usability.
