<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
  Syrinx has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We are committed to
  protecting your privacy and personal information you provide or as you access and use materials on
  <a href="https://www.syrinx.com/">www.syrinx.com</a> (the "Site", "Website"), including the Site contact pages or
  other websites, or apps that post a link to this Privacy Statement. In addition, information that you submit to Syrinx
  in response to an email request for information or other outreach from Syrinx, or through our employment application
  processes, will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
</p>

<p>
  Syrinx may, at its discretion, amend this Privacy Statement from time to time. To ensure you can remain informed about
  the information we collect and how we use it, material changes to our statement will be reflected here. This Site may
  contain links to external sites which are not governed by this Privacy Statement. Syrinx does not take responsibility
  for the privacy practices of any third-party sites to which we link. We encourage you to review the privacy policies
  of any such sites before you submit information there.
</p>

<h1>Your Acceptance of This Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
  Please read this Privacy Statement carefully. By browsing our Website and expressly consenting where required (for
  instance, when submitting your application), you agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement.
</p>

<h1>Information About All Site Visitors</h1>

<p>
  In general, Syrinx gathers information about users of this Site collectively, such as what areas users visit most
  frequently, the pages users access the most, and the links to our partners that users most often visit. Syrinx only
  uses such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most useful and beneficial for our users,
  and how we can continually improve the services and features provided to the users of our site. We may share this
  collected information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how our Site
  users, collectively, use this Site in order that they may create a better overall experience for you as well.
</p>

<h1>Personal Information</h1>

<p>
  In some instances, such as when you sign up to use certain services, apply for a position, enter into a contest or
  promotion, or complete a survey for internal research, Syrinx may in the future ask for more specific information such
  as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, skill sets and demographic information. Such information may
  be stored indefinitely and may be collected and processed in one or more databases maintained directly or indirectly
  by Syrinx. In addition to identification, registration and authentication, Syrinx may, with your consent as indicated
  by your checking 'Yes' on the profile form associated with any collection, use such information to contact you
  regarding potential employment opportunities, changes to and new offerings on our Site or to make you aware of
  additional products, services, specific events and promotions from Syrinx or its partners which may be of interest to
  you.
</p>

<p>
  From time to time, Syrinx may also ask you for other information via surveys, such as information regarding your areas
  of interest, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, your career goals, services that you would like offered on
  this site, and other such information that will help us improve the service and features made available to you on this
  site. You may opt-out of receiving any further Internet-based communication from Syrinx or its partners by following
  the Choice/Opt-Out provided with each communication or by contacting us via the link below.

<h1>Information Disclosure</h1>

<p>
  Syrinx will not knowingly disclose to any third party information about your individual visits to this Site or your
  name, address, e-mail address or your telephone number without your prior consent, except when we believe that the law
  requires such disclosure to a third party. Syrinx may record and share aggregated information with our partners.
</p>

<h1>Resumes</h1>

<p>
  You have the option of submitting your resume to Syrinx. When you send your resume to Syrinx, your resume is entered
  into the Syrinx resume database and will be assigned to a Syrinx recruiter who may contact you as relevant employment
  opportunities arise. A recruiter will always speak to you about an opportunity before submitting your resume and will
  not submit a resume to a client without your prior consent. Syrinx uses its best efforts to grant access to your
  resume only to such third-party clients for whom you have given your consent. However, Syrinx is not responsible or
  liable if some other third party evades security measures and gains access to the resume database, and, subsequently,
  your resume. Syrinx's clients, to whom your resume has been sent with your consent, may have retained a copy of your
  resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in such
  instances.
</p>

<h1>Retention of Your Personal Information</h1>

<p>
  Syrinx retains your personal information for so long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected.
  We may retain your personal information for longer if they may be the subject of a legal claim or may otherwise be
  relevant for future litigation.
</p>

  ability to unsubscribe from such communications by means of a link provided in every e-mail that is sent to you by us
  or by contacting us via the link below. When subscribing to Syrinx e-mail newsletters, you are given the opportunity
