Hope is designed to be motivational, empathic, and most importantly, non-judgmental. She encourages behaviors to help users create and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The Hope App asks users about their mood, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, quality and quantity of meals, exercise habits, and symptoms of depression.
