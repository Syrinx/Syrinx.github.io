Unlike outsourcing firms run by recruiters, we don't barrage you with resumes in response to a problem. Syrinx's experienced developers are engaged in every step of the process, from the initial sales inquiry to the sourcing decisions. They take the time to understand your business and technical needs upfront, and work with senior resource managers to decide the right skill set for the job. We then send you exactly the right resources for the job, whether it's one developer or a whole team, saving you the time and hassle of interviewing, screening, and vetting technical resources. As a result, you get expertise and service tailored to your needs. Our reputation speaks for itself. Our clients trust us to deliver consistently high-quality talent, on-time and on-budget. We love what we do, and we do it well.</p><h1>The Moral</h1><blockquote><p>Those who adapt to the times will emerge unscathed.</p></blockquote><p>We believe that the only constant in the business world is change. That's why reeds are featured in our logo, along with a swath of motion symbolizing change. Syrinx strives to build systems that are resilient to change, and allow our customers to grow and adapt as they need to. We aim to keep abreast of the ever changing technology landscape, always looking to improve our efficiency, portability, re-usability, and time to market.</p><hr><h2>Andrew Gelina</h2><h4 class="title">CEO, Syrinx Consulting Corporation</h4><img class="profilePic" src="http://www.syrinx.com/img/team_andrew.png"><p>Andrew Gelina brings over 18 years of software architecture and development experience to his role as CEO of Syrinx Consulting, where he is responsible for the strategic direction, technology focus, operations management, and growth of the firm.

In classical mythology, Syrinx was a river nymph who was pursued by the Greek god Pan. To escape his advances, she ran to the river's edge and was transformed into hollow water reeds.The reed is the classic symbol of resilience in the face of change. It is also the basis for the Aesop's fable, "The Oak Tree and the Reed":</p><blockquote><p>A reed got into an argument with an oak tree. The oak tree boasted that her strength could withstand a battle against the winds, while she condemned the reed for being weak, yielding to every breeze. Then the wind began to blow very fiercely. The oak tree was torn up by her roots and toppled over, while the reed was left bent but unharmed.</p></blockquote></article></main><div class="shim reversed"></div><aside><h1>Have a project we can help with?</h1><a href="/contact">Talk To Us <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></aside><div class="shim"></div><footer><nav><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/services">Services</a> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> <a href="/company">Company</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> <a href="/contact">Contact</a></nav><p id="social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-facebook-official"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://medium.com/@SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-medium"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/syrinx-consulting-corporation"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p><p>Copyright &copy; 2016 Syrinx Consulting Corporation.
